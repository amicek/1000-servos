My challenge was to make many servos work independently. I decided to use 35 servos and three drive boards to control them using only one arduino board.  
The first challenge was to find the proper library which will be working well with servos. All the libraries I found were designed for LEDs. 
When I finally found the one designed for Servos but it seemed to not work at all so I adjusted the code for LEDs.
