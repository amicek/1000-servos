Also upload any schematics
(hand drawn or cad are both fine) or diagrams you need. In your README.md file,
include both what you did and what the major challenges were. In particular,
what did you try that *didn't* work? How can others avoid those false starts?
Include stupid, mundane things (except maybe typos).

documentation, pictures, code, diagrams
